3. **Create backend repository** for server-side code

### Long-term Actions:
1. **Develop complete backend API**
2. **Add user authentication system**
3. **Implement admin dashboard**
4. **Add payment integration**
5. **Set up automated testing**

## 📈 Current Frontend Functionality

### What Users Can Do:
✅ Browse services and information
✅ View doctor details and facility info
✅ Fill out appointment booking form
✅ See appointment confirmation page
✅ Navigate between pages smoothly

### What's Missing:
❌ Actual appointment booking persistence
❌ Email confirmations
❌ Admin management system
❌ User accounts

❌ Real-time availability checking

## 🎯 Conclusion

Your frontend application is **professionally built and fully functional** from a user interface perspective. The code quality is excellent, and the user experience is smooth. However, to have a **complete diagnostic center management system**, you need to develop the backend infrastructure.

The current application serves well as a **business showcase and information portal**, but requires backend development for **actual appointment management functionality**.
